## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Gentle rose (#E9967A). Rose evokes a feeling of warmth, caring, and friendship.
- Background color: Light-desaturated rose (#F8E8E2). Using a highly desaturated version of the primary provides harmony.
- Accent color: Muted lavender (#B48EAD). This provides contrast, but maintains a gentle tone aligned to caring for elders.
- Headline font: 'Belleza', sans-serif; Body font: 'Alegreya', serif. Chosen for artful appeal and readability.
- Use simple, easily recognizable icons to represent different functions (e.g., a telephone for calls, a speech bubble for chat, etc.)
- Employ a clear, senior-friendly mobile navigation system with prominent buttons, spacious touch targets, and large font sizes as detailed in https://www.figma.com/design/f99I7WsFJpBXlbG4ECNWCV/SEHATERA?node-id=2-6&t=JKWlVXaWaxygPBec-1
